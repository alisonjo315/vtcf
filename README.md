# Views Taxonomy Checkbox Filters - Drupal 8 module
This module adds checkbox taxonomy filters to views using contextual filters. 

Reason for creating this module is that https://www.drupal.org/project/better_exposed_filters does not support checkboxes for taxonomies yet. 

This module is work in progress.
